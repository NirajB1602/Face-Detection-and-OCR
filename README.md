# Face Recognition and OCR using OpenCV and Tesseract

## Overview

This project is a Python application that combines the power of openCV, Tesseract, and Pillow to perform two essential tasks: Face Recognition and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Face Recognition involves detecting and recognizing faces within images, while OCR is the process of extracting text from images. In this project I took a ZIP file of images and processed it. The ZIP file bundles several files together to save space. In this case, it contains newspaper images, like the ones we explored in week 3. My task was to write Python code that enabled me to search for specific keywords and faces within these images.

For example, if I searched for "pizza," the code should return a contact sheet displaying all the faces found on the newspaper pages mentioning "pizza." This project challenged my ability to grasp a new library, use OpenCV for face detection, apply Tesseract for optical character recognition, and utilize PIL to create contact sheets.

The newspapers are stored as individual PNG images within the "images.zip" file. They're in English and encompass a wide range of stories, advertisements, and images. 

Please note that this file is relatively large (around 200 MB) and may take some time to process. To get started, I considered using the "small_img.zip" for testing purposes.

## Features

1. **Face Recognition:** Detect faces within images and generate contact sheets of identified faces.

2. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** Extract text from images for further processing and analysis.
